abstract = {We present a case study in which a novel testing tool, Quviq QuickCheck, is used to test an industrial implementation of the Megaco protocol. We considered positive and negative testing and we used our developed specification to test an old version in order to estimate how useful QuickCheck could potentially be when used early in development.The results of the case study indicate that, by using Quviq QuickCheck, we would have been able to detect faults early in the development.We detected faults that had not been detected by other testing techniques. We found unclarities in the specifications and potential faults when the software is used in a different setting. The results are considered promising enough to Ericsson that they are investing in an even larger case study, this time from the beginning of the development of a new product.},
