  abstract={Human-centered methods can help researchers better understand and meet programmers' needs. Because programming is a human activity, many of these methods can be used without change. However, some programmer needs require new methods, which can also be applied to domains other than software engineering. This article features five Web extras. The video at https://youtu.be/4PH9-qi-yTQ demonstrates Azurite, an Eclipse plug-in with a selective undo feature that lets programmers more easily backtrack their code. The video at https://youtu.be/gOSlR62-rd8 describes Graphite, an Eclipse plug-in offering active code completion, a simple but powerful technique that integrates useful code-generation tools directly into the editor. The video at https://youtu.be/zyrqcYxqDtI describes HANDS, a new programming system that emphasizes usability by building on children's and beginning programmers' natural problem-solving tendencies. The video extra at https://youtu.be/80EctbI7PFc describes Whyline, a debugging tool that lets developers ask questions about their program's output and behavior. The video at https://youtu.be/3L4MK2dG_6k demonstrates the prototype for Whyline, a debugging tool that lets developers pose questions about their program's output.},
