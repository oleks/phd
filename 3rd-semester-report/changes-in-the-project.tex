\section{Changes in the Project}

Compared to the original project
description\footnote{\url{https://github.com/oleks/phd/releases/download/pre-signed-project-description/oleks-phd-project-description.pdf}},
there is now less focus on re-implementing or maturing Emerald, and
more on evaluating the programming paradigm originally afforded by it,
in general. Distributed Mobile Clouds are identified as the particular
contemporary domain of applications where Emerald, or variants of it,
may prove their worth.
